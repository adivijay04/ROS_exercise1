# Robot Operating System (ROS)
An open-source middleware package for robotics is called Robot Operating System (ROS). While not an operating system (OS), ROS is a collection of software frameworks for the creation of robot software. As such, it offers services like hardware abstraction, low-level device control, the implementation of frequently used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management that are intended for a heterogeneous computer cluster. A graph architecture is used to describe the running sets of ROS-based processes, with processing taking place in nodes that can receive, post, and multiplex messages relating to control, state, planning, actuators, and other topics.
